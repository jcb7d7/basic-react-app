Objective:

Step 1:

Using the Fetch API, issue a AJAX GET request to the following URL (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and store the results in the people array in the component state. Be sure to follow best practices for React when assigning this data to the variable.

Step 2:
Using the User component, render each user from the API response as a list item in the unordered list <ul> provided. Be sure pass in the corresponding company name and email address, along with the name of the user. The finished product should look something like this: https://i.imgur.com/hAal16w.png

Step 3: (optional)

Modify the User component to output more details about each team member using data from the API response. Feel free to use SCSS or a third party API to enrich the data. Adding documentation or refactoring code to improve readability or performance is also encouraged :)
